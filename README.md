## Frequently Asked Questions
#### What if the model you want is not available?
If conditions permit, you can design or find a suitable 3D model externally and upload it to the scene. Or give us feedback on the type of model you want.

#### Do you need to know programming to use iCraft Editor?
You don't need to know programming to use iCraft Editor. iCraft Editor is not only for architectural design, but can also be used in any scene that needs to express structural relationships.

#### Is it completely free to use iCraft Editor?
It is completely free to use iCraft Editor online

#### Can I integrate the designed 3D scene into my other projects?
You can use iCraft Player for project integration, display 3D scenes, link elements and animation effects.

## Conclusion
The transition from 2D to 3D is an inevitable trend in the development of architecture diagrams. With the continuous advancement of technology and the continuous improvement of application needs, 3D architecture diagrams will play an important role in more fields.

From 2D to 3D, iCraft 3D Editor helps you easily draw intuitive three-dimensional architecture diagrams, making complex systems clear at a glance!
