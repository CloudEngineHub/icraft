# PlayerBar

Player toolbar for controlling play, pause, stop, previous step, next step, loop control and other operations.

## How to Use

- Enable the player toolbar quickly by configuring `addons={["PlayerBar"]}`
- Or manually enable it by importing `import { PlayerBar } from "@icraft/player-react"`. Manual enabling allows more flexible control over the player toolbar's style.
