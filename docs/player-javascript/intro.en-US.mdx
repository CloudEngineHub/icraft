@icraft/player is a native JavaScript component that allows you to easily integrate scenes edited in iCraft Editor into your projects, providing rich interaction events and methods.

## Quick Start

### Installation

#### npm
Install the `@icraft/player` package using npm or pnpm:

```bash
# Using npm
npm install @icraft/player --save

# Or using pnpm
pnpm install @icraft/player --save
```

Note: Some package managers may not automatically install the `@icraft/engine` package. If it's missing, please install it manually:

#### CDN

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/@icraft/player@latest/dist/umd/icraft-player.min.js"></script>
```

### Basic Usage

#### ESM
```js
import ICraftPlayer from '@icraft/player'
```

#### CDN
```js
const ICraftPlayer = window.ICraftPlayer
```

Create a player instance:

```js
const player = new ICraftPlayer({
  src: 'your-scene.iplayer',
  container: document.getElementById('container'),
});
```

Here, `src` is the URL of the `.iplayer` file exported from iCraft Editor, and `container` is the DOM element that will host the scene.
