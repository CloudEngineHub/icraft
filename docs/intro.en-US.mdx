# Introduction

Using the iCraft Player front-end component, you can easily integrate scenes edited by iCraft Editor into your project and provide rich interactive functions.
## How to use

First, you need to install the `@icraft/player` package:

```bash
pnpm install @icraft/player --save
```

Then, import the `ICraftPlayer` component in your project and pass in the `fileUrl` property, with the value of the `.iplayer` file address exported by iCraft Editor.

```jsx
import { ICraftPlayer } from "@icraft/player";

export default () => {
return <ICraftPlayer fileUrl='*.iplayer' />;
};
```

Open your project in a browser, and you should be able to see the scene edited by iCraft Editor embedded in the page.
