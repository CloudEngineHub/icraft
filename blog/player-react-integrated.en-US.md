# iCraft Editor 3D Architecture Software Officially Releases @icraft/player-react Frontend Component for Easy Integration of 3D Architecture Diagrams into Your Projects

## Introduction

@icraft/player-react is a newly launched React component library by iCraft Editor, specifically designed to simplify frontend integration of 3D digital twin scenarios. Through this component, developers can easily embed 3D scenes created in iCraft Editor into their React projects, gaining rich interactive capabilities and real-time data integration features.

## Features

- ðŸš€ **Ready to Use** - Zero configuration integration, just a few lines of code to get started
- ðŸŽ¨ **Custom Plugin Sets** - Support for optional features through a flexible plugin mechanism
- ðŸ”Œ **Practical Events and Methods** - Provides rich events and methods for easy integration with your project
- ðŸŽ¬ **Animation Control** - Support for autoplay, loop playback, and other animation controls
- ðŸ”Œ **Real-time Data Integration** - Support for real-time data integration to achieve digital twins

## Installation

```bash
pnpm install @icraft/player-react --save
```

## Usage

Just a few lines of code to integrate 3D scenes into your React project:

```tsx
import { ICraftPlayer } from "@icraft/player-react";
 
export default function MyScene() {
  return <ICraftPlayer src='your-scene.iplayer' />;
}
```

> **Important Note**: The `.iplayer` file needs to be exported from iCraft Editor. This is an optimized 3D scene file format that contains complete scene information. You can obtain this file through the "Export" function after editing your scene in iCraft Editor.
